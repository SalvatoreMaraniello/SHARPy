Requirements: 
Python 2.7
OpenMDAO v0.10.0 (or back-compatibles)


Install OpenMDAO:
- download go-openmdao-0.10.0.py from http://openmdao.org/downloads/recent/
- go to the folder where you want to install the libraries and run the script from terminal.
- optional:
	- to install the pyOpt/ipopt plugin, activate Openmdao environment and type:
		- plugin install --github pyopt_driver/ipoptdriver
		- for further details, refer to:
			- http://openmdao.org/docs/tutorials/optimization/optimizers.html
			- http://openmdao.org/docs/getting-started/using_plugins.html
		
	

Setup Optimiser:
- in shared.py, set openmdao_abspath to point at the directory where the openmdao libraries where installed. 
- because during the installation openmdao makes a local copy of the packages installed on your machine, it is likely that all the paths to the egg files may need to be changed manually.
