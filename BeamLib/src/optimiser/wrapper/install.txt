------------------------------------------------


Requirements: 
Python 2.7
OpenMDAO v0.10.0 (or back-compatibles)


Install OpenMDAO:
- download go-openmdao-0.10.0.py from http://openmdao.org/downloads/recent/
- go to the folder where you want to install the libraries and run the script from terminal.

Setup Optimiser:
- in shared.py, set openmdao_abspath to point at the directory where the openmdao libraries where installed. 
- because during the installation openmdao makes a local copy of the packages installed on your machine, it is likely that all the paths to the egg files may need to be changed manually.
